1. To run my code, open it with pycharm or other editors. 
In the terminal, type: pipenv shell (assuming .idea folder install django for you? not entirely sure how that works). 
Once you've entered a virtual environment equipped with django, do the following: python manage.py runserver. 
Once you do, clicked on the link that popped up and you will hit home and you can play around with it according to the webpages.

2. I don't have bugs when run on my laptop.

3. I completed all the functionality the model website had. 

4. I did likes and comments.

5. It was super cool to create something from scratch using a combination of languages that I'm very very unfamililar with. As I told Jerry, this project took a lot longer to finish and I realized that to actually be able to do something, it's NOT enough to find tutorials online as there won't be one exactly like your goal and you'll have to learn from scratch what the differences are anyways. The project forced me to read through a lot of django documentations and stack overflow posts; the amount i've learned from doing what it seems like a simple project is very much surprising to me. Overall a super cool experience!
